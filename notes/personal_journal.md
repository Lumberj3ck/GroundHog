## Morning Reflection:
Felt a bit groggy this morning. I think I'll try to go to bed earlier tonight.
Read a fascinating article about neuroplasticity by Dr. Isabelle Reed. It mentioned how learning new skills, like playing the guitar, can rewire the brain. It's something I've always wanted to do.

## Afternoon:
Had a quick lunch with an old friend, David. We talked about his recent trip to Japan. He recommended I visit Kyoto if I ever get the chance.

## Evening Plans:
- Need to buy a birthday gift for Sarah. Her party is this weekend.
- Finish reading the last chapter of my book.
- Maybe look up some beginner guitar lessons online.
